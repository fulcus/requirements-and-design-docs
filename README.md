# requirements-and-design-docs - CLup

_This repository has been created as part of the "Software Engineering 2" course at Politecnico di Milano._

__*CLup*__ is an application that aims enforce social distancing rules by avoiding lines at supermarkets.

The `deliveries` folder contains the final PDF version of both _DD_ and _RASD_ parts.

## The documents

### Requirements Analysis and Specification Document

The Requirement analysis and specification document (RASD) contains the description of the scenarios, the use cases that describe them, and the models describing requirements and specification for the problem under consideration. You are to use a suitable mix of natural language, UML, and Alloy. Any Alloy model should be validated through the tool, by reporting the models obtained by using it and/or by showing the results of assertion checks. Of course, the initial written problem statement we provide suffers from the typical drawbacks of natural language descriptions: it is informal, incomplete, uses different terms for the same concepts, and the like. You may choose to solve the incompleteness and ambiguity as you wish, but be careful to clearly document the choices you make and the corresponding rationale.

### Design Document

The Design document (DD) must contain a functional description of the system, and any other view you find useful to provide. You should use all the UML diagrams you need to provide and full description of the system.
